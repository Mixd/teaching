CSS Preprocessors
====

This practical is very hands-on and non-restrictive. There's no pre-set tasks with time limits. Jason and Luke will be hovering around to assist you in anything you need help with.

Our goal is to get you up and running with Sass, and using it comfortably.

## Task 1: Download a compiler

* __[CodeKit](https://incident57.com/codekit/)__ (Mac) ($)
* [Hammer for Mac](http://hammerformac.com/) (Mac) ($)
* [Mixture](http://mixture.io/) (Windows + Mac) ($)
* [Scout](http://mhs.github.io/scout-app/) (Windows + Mac) (FREE)

$ - Paid software (although they all have free trials)

## Task 2: Look through and play with the examples

Each one of the features I spoke about has an example in this repo. Have a play with each one in turn, seeing how they work.

* Nesting
* Variables
* Import
* Functions / Math
* Mixins

**Note:** If you're struggling to get Sass running locally on your machine, you can see all my examples working on *CodePen*:

* [Nesting](http://codepen.io/thecodezombie/pen/dzIDo)
* [Variables](http://codepen.io/thecodezombie/pen/KcCui)
* ~~Import~~
* [Functions / Math](http://codepen.io/thecodezombie/pen/FBHCG)
* [Mixins](http://codepen.io/thecodezombie/pen/bInsH)

## Task 3: Convert your own project to Sass

Find one of your pre-existing HTML/CSS projects, and see how you can apply Sass to it.

## Feeling Adventurous?: Look at the Mixd Front-end Framework!

Take a look at the [Mixd Front-end Framework](https://github.com/Mixd/frontend-framework). Get it set up locally but looking at the `readme.md` and have a look at how we use Sass with Grunt. Start building something (perhaps your portfolio?) using our framework and see how you get on.
