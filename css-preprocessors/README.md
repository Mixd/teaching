CSS Preprocessors
====

This practical is very hands-on and non-restrictive. There's no pre-set tasks with time limits. Jason and Luke will be hovering around to assist you in anything you need help with.

Our goal is to get you up and running with Sass, and using it comfortably.

## Task 1: Download a compiler

* __[CodeKit](https://codekitapp.com/)__ (Windows + Mac) ($34)
* [Scout](http://scout-app.io/) (Windows + Mac) (FREE)

## Task 2: Look through and play with the examples

Each one of the features I spoke about has an example in this repo. Have a play with each one in turn, seeing how they work.

* Nesting
* Variables
* Import
* Functions / Math
* Mixins

**Note:** If you're struggling to get Sass running locally on your machine, you can see all my examples working on *CodePen*:

* [Nesting](http://codepen.io/thecodezombie/pen/dzIDo)
* [Variables](http://codepen.io/thecodezombie/pen/KcCui)
* ~~Import~~
* [Functions / Math](http://codepen.io/thecodezombie/pen/FBHCG)
* [Mixins](http://codepen.io/thecodezombie/pen/bInsH)

## Task 3: Buttons!

The humble button. Just one common element, but so many possibilities. Create a basic-looking button – `.btn` – but extend it to have lots of different variations, like:

* Colour (+gradient?)
* Square / rounded corner / 'pill'
* Small / large
* Slim / chunky
* With an icon (eg. right arrow)
* Shadow

Use what you've learnt about object-oriented CSS (aka. BEM), as well as the features of SASS, to create a button that can exist with any of the above combination. I'll likely live code my own on screen for anyone who wants to follow along / get ideas.

## Optional: Convert your own project to Sass

Find one of your pre-existing HTML/CSS projects, and see how you can apply Sass to make it better...more maintainable / less repetitive.


## Feeling Adventurous?: Look at the Mixd Front-end Framework!

Take a look at the [Mixd Front-end Framework](https://github.com/Mixd/frontend-framework). Get it set up locally but looking at the `readme.md` and have a look at how we use Sass with Grunt. Start building something (perhaps your portfolio?) using our framework and see how you get on.
