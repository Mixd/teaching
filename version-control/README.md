# Version Control

## [GitHub Student Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)
A great __FREE__ pack from GitHub, that gives you some great stuff for web development (amongst other industries). We'd suggest getting it for:

* [Atom](https://atom.io/): Still in its infancy, but a solid IDE for web development. Unlike other IDEs, it's __FREE__.
* [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/): A solid hosting company for web developers. With the student pack, you'd get $100 credit; which depending on the package you choose is between 10-20 months free hosting!
* [GitHub Micro](https://github.com/): Gives you unlimited private repositories for free; which would usually cost Â£4 a month.

## Version Control / Git GUI's
Interacting with Version Control typically works best straight from terminal / commandline, but to get started you might be more comfortable using one of the following apps.

* [SourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) (Win / Mac)
* [GitBox](http://www.gitboxapp.com/) (Mac)
* [Tower](http://www.git-tower.com/) (Mac)
* GitHub for [Mac](https://mac.github.com/) / [Windows](https://mac.github.com/)
* [Cornerstone](http://www.zennaware.com/cornerstone/index.php) (Mac)
