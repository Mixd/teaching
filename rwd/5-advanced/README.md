In task four you handled the the sub-elements often found in a header. Whilst difficult, the header is often handled in isolation. Now you have to handle the complexities of nested grid layouts.

The files you'll need for this task are within the `task-1` folder.

The content section has a selection of images, and to make best use of the available space, it makes sense to stack them to a row. But there's also some sidebar panels alongside the content to consider.

## Task 2
The files you'll need for this task are within the `task-2` folder.
