# From wireframes to code
This section will allow you to explore a more complex layout for Responsive Web Design.

In task four, you covered the complexities of a header, but now concentrate on making a complicated header work on all devices.

## Task 1
The files you'll need for this task are within the `task-1` folder.

The content section has a selection of images, and to make best use of the available space, it makes sense to stack them to a row. But there's also some sidebar panels alongside the content to consider. You may want to look back on `2-layouts/task-2` for inspiration, and perhaps work upon that basic grid to make something work for this layout.
