# Responsive Web Design Workshop
This is the repository used for the Responsive Web Design workshop curated and run by [Mixd](http://www.mixd.co.uk/). The content of this workshop is free to use, however, attribution would be appreciated.

## Working with this repository
If you're planning on working through the various tasks then you'll want the entire repository locally on your system.

### [**Download ZIP**](https://github.com/Mixd/teaching/archive/master.zip)
Once downloaded, everything you need will be within the `rwd` folder. The instructions for each of the sections (shown below) are within `.md` files (short for [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), I'd recommend viewing these files in Github.

## Structure
The workshop is split into 4 different sections:

- **1.Basics**: Learning the basic syntax
- **2.Layouts**: Working with Media Queries to create layouts and Structure through Grids
- **3.Wireframing**: Create simple wireframes for your site at different device widths
- **4.Convertion**: Moving your wireframes and putting them into code
- **5.Extras**: A resources folder to help you along the way
