# From wireframes to code
This section will allow you to explore Responsive Web Design. Looking back on the wireframes you've created, how can we create these layouts in a way that will be usable for all devices?

We'll be using your wireframes of the original layout which you were asked to produce in the previous task. The elements you should have are as followed:
- Logo
- Primary navigation consisting of 4 links: Home, Products, Services, Blog
- Extra links: About Us, Contact Us, FAQ
- Search form
- Content: Page title, text and 4 small content blocks
- Sidebar: 3 x panels
- Footer: Tertiary links, Copyright

## Task 1
The files you'll need for this task are within the `task-1` folder.

### Step 1
First of all, lets look at the header section. Based on the above, we could have the following within the header:
- Logo
- Primary Navigation
- Search form
- Secondary Links

Open up `index.html`, you'll see the base HTML has been created. This most likely won't work for what you need, think about how you can structure your HTML to work with the layout you've created for the header. Can it even be done? Is there a better way? How will you strucutre it in a way that works for all devices?

### Step 2
Once you have some structured HTML down for your header, lets do the CSS. Think about how you can create your styles in a way that will work for any device. Will the navigation change from a blocked-list of elements at mobile to a side-by-side layout on larger devices?

**PRO TIP** - While you may initially think a grid would be good for a header, try to avoid doing so. You don't really get the flexibility from a grid system that's often required to make a header use the best available space.
