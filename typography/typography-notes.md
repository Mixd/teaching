# Typography on the web

[Practical Typography](http://practicaltypography.com/) is a great run-down of everything to do with typography on the web.
I also wrote an article that covers the topics of this session â€“ [Web Font Basics](http://thecodezombie.co.uk/blog/web-font-basics/).

## @font-face
* [Font Squirrel](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/)
* [My Fonts](http://www.myfonts.com/)

## Type Services
* [Typekit](https://typekit.com/)
* [Fonts.com](https://www.fonts.com/)
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) (free)
* [Hoefler & Frere-Jones](http://www.typography.com/)

## Sandboxing
There's also [Typecast](http://typecast.com/), where you can play with the fonts from many services, in the browser.

## Font Choice & Pairings
* [Just my Type](http://justmytype.co/) by [Dan Eden](https://twitter.com/_dte)...he's also done specific pairings for Typekit and H&FJ.

## Vertical Rhythm
* [Technical Web Typography: Guidelines & Techniques](http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/03/14/technical-web-typography-guidelines-and-techniques/) by [Harry Roberts](https://twitter.com/csswizardry)
